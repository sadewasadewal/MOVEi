## 📖 Overview

**MOVEI** is an iOS application designed to elevate the cinema ticket booking experience. Built from the ground up with **SwiftUI** and **SwiftData**, MOVEI features an immersive full-bleed movie carousel, visual seat selection, an interactive stacked card wallet, and an authentic **physical swipe-to-tear ticket** with real-time perforation haptics and an admitted seal.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎞️ 1. Hero Movie Carousel (Home)
- **Fluid Horizontal Carousel**: Swipe horizontally between featured titles (*Wicked, Brand New Day, Oppenheimer, Interstellar, Barbie, The Batman, and more*).
- **Stationary Safe-Area Anchor**: The hero poster sits behind the Dynamic Island and status bar with zero vertical bounce or pull-down disruption.
- **Movie Metadata**: High-resolution backdrop art, Rotten Tomatoes / IMDb-style ratings, genres, runtime, tagline, and direct booking triggers.

### 🎟️ 2. Dynamic Movie Wallet
- **Layered 3D Card Stack**: Displays upcoming cinema passes with peek cards stacked behind the active ticket.
- **Gesture Navigation**: Swipe left or right on the main ticket card or tap any background peek card to bring it forward.
- **Pass Counter**: Dynamic badge displaying active pass count.
- **"All Passes" Browser**: Compact overview list below the stack with instant card selection.
- **Wallet Pass Management (Three-Dots Menu)**:
  - **Delete Active Pass**: Removes the currently selected movie ticket.
  - **Clear All Passes**: Batch-clears the wallet with confirmation modal protection.
  - **Context Menus**: Long-press any ticket in the "All Passes" list to delete it individually.

### ✂️ 3. Physical Swipe-to-Tear Ticket
- **Clean Perforation Line**: Located directly above the barcode with authentic circular edge notches and dotted perforation stitches.
- **Real-Time Drag Haptics**: Swiping your finger across the dotted line provides continuous mechanical perforation feedback (`UIImpactFeedbackGenerator(style: .rigid)` per stitch).
- **Spring-Animated Separation**: Completing the tear smoothly opens a clean `18pt` vertical space between the movie pass and the detached barcode stub.
- **Ink-Stamped "ADMITTED" Seal**: Stamped across the barcode with a red dashed border, checkmark seal, and showtime timestamp.
- **"Tape Ticket Back"**: Restore and re-tear the pass at any time.
- **Wallet Return**: Top-left `< Wallet` navigation button returns directly to the Movie Wallet.

### 💺 4. Interactive Booking Flow
- **Theater Selection**: Choose between nearby theaters (*Cinemax Colombo, Scope Cinemas, Majestic City*).
- **Showtime Picker**: Select upcoming screening times.
- **Interactive Seat Picker**: Visual seat grid with live selection state and automatic price calculation.
- **Barcode Generation**: Automatically generates a native Code 128 barcode (`CICode128BarcodeGenerator`) and unique ticket ID (`MOV-XXXXXX`).

### 📱 5. Clean Bottom Navigation
- Modern, floating glassmorphism tab bar with 4 primary destinations:
  1. **Home**: Full-screen hero carousel & spotlights
  2. **Movies**: Browse cinema lineup & search
  3. **Wallet**: Stacked passes, management & ticket inspection
  4. **Profile**: User account & cinema settings
